Use the Admission_Predict.csv Preview the document data. You can either decide on bin size (width of each bar) and then make the appropriate calculations to make the histogram or use the d3.histogram() function.

Note that your histogram may not look exactly like this. The number of bars and height of each bar may be different depending on the bin size you choose to use
